- [Using AI to unleash the power of unstructured government data](https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/cognitive-technologies/natural-language-processing-examples-in-government-data.html): (W. Eggers, N. Malik, & M. Gracie, January 2019). “Think of unstructured text as being ‘trapped’ in physical and virtual file cabinets. The promise is clear: Governments could improve effectiveness and prevent many catastrophes by improving their ability to ‘connect the dots’ and identify patterns in available data.” This Deloitte article provides an easy-to-comprehend primer and background on NLP, and the various applications NLP could be used on unstructured Government text data. The article includes many US Government examples on how NLP is currently deployed across different domains (e.g. to help analyze public feedback/sentiment analysis/topic modelling, to improve forensic investigations, to aid in Government policy-making and regulatory compliance). The key point is to apply different NLP techniques to explore and uncover key Government intelligence insights.
- [Extracting Features of Entertainment Products: A Guided Latent Dirichlet Allocation Approach Informed by the Psychology of Media Consumption](https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243718820559): (O. Toubia, G. Iyengar, R. Bunnell, & A. Lemaire, February 2019). “We rely on the NLP literature to develop a method for tagging entertainment products in an automated and scalable manner. In the context of movies, we first show that the proposed features improve our ability to predict consumption at the individual level… We also show that guided LDA features have the potential to improve the performance of models that predict aggregate performance outcomes rather than individual-level consumption.” This academic article provides both a framework and managerial implications that suggest the application of LDA and NLP for feature extraction in entertainment products that can aid in traditional content-based consumer behavior models, and relevant marketing models applied to the media and entertainment industry.

The idea aims to capture hierarchincal relationships in the input layer through dynamic routing between "capsules" of neurons. Due likely to the affinitity of the theme of addressing hierarchical complexities, the idea's extention to the NLP field has since been a sujbect of active research, such as in the papers listed above.
